In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with regard to properties declared using `nonatomic, strong`.  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    self.myString = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"Hello, world!"];
    // ... some other code ...
}
@end
```

While seemingly harmless, if `someMethod` is called multiple times, each call creates a new string and retains it.  If `myString` is never released appropriately, such as before `self` is deallocated, it leads to a memory leak.  This is more insidious than typical memory leaks because the error might not be immediately apparent unless the app runs for a prolonged period or uses a significant number of these objects.

Another issue, related to this is improper usage of `copy`. Using `copy` instead of `strong` can unexpectedly retain objects that are not meant to be retained, leading to a different type of memory management issue.
